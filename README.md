# MMMD
Monarrk's Marvelous Markdown

### Precursor
I am fully aware that this code is horrendous.

### Building
Building is as easy as `cc mmmd.c`.

### Usage
MMMD takes a mmmd file and outputs HTML.

To test it out, use the examples/test.mmmd file.

To make a test.html file, run `mmmd examples/test.mmmd > test.html`

You can view it with `$BROWSER test.html` where $BROWSER is a web browser like firefox or chrome.
